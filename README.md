A major challenge in identifying party strategies is identifying where, when and how candidates carry out activities during the electoral campaign. The TSE made records of income and expenses made during each candidate's campaign available. Among the many pieces of information contained there, the number of the bank and branch of the beneficiary of the transactions indicated by the candidates was collected and cross-referenced with a list of bank branch addresses in Brazil. From these crossings, it was possible to georeference the expenses of candidates for the national legislature for the entire country and thus build a proxy for campaign strategies in the electoral dispute. This unprecedented database will make it possible to advance the understanding of how the electoral campaign is constructed, what strategies are used and also how the relationship between representatives and citizens occurs, as it will be possible to dissociate campaign efforts from the election result.
